ptserver
=======

A server application for testing / documenting / debugging the old Paltalk
protocol and client.

This is still incomplete but largely functional.

Just build with the ``Makefile`` and enjoy.

You'll want to add the following to your /etc/hosts for the client:
```
127.0.0.1	www.paltalk.com
127.0.0.1	advertising.paltalk.com
127.0.0.1	router.paltalk-entry.com
```
